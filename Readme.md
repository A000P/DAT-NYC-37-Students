## How to submit assignments
1. Fork the students repository:
   https://github.com/ga-students/DAT-NYC-37-Students
1. Add your own folder with the format `firstname_lastname` within the
   `/projects` folder of this repository. (example: `DAT-NYC-37-Students/projects/anthony_erlinger`).
1. Commit your changes and push to github
1. Submit a pull request with your newly commited directory. Github has
   a great tutorial on this here:

https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.
 
*You can also use the "Upload files" button to upload your homework,
though I strongly recommend becoming accustomed to using git with github*
